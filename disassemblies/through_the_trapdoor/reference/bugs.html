<div class="box-title">Direction Berk is facing flips instantly</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Under certain conditions, Berk will flip instantly from facing into the screen to facing out of the screen, without an intermediate turning animation.
For example, if:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="">
<li>Berk is at the right edge of a room,</li>
<li>there is no room to the right of that room,</li>
<li>he is not flying,</li>
<li>he is facing into the screen, and</li>
<li>right is pressed</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
then he will flip instantly.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this is as follows. Under the conditions above, when right is pressed, execution jumps to <a href="../asm/36116.html#36214">36214</a>. At <a href="../asm/36116.html#36221">36221</a> his facing-into-screen flag
is reset. A check is done at <a href="../asm/36116.html#36230">36230</a> that determines that Berk cannot enter a new room to the right, so the jump at <a href="../asm/36116.html#36233">36233</a> takes place; execution now
jumps to <a href="../asm/35735.html#35786">35786</a>. The check at <a href="../asm/35735.html#35786">35786</a> determines that Berk is not flying, so execution jumps to <a href="../asm/35735.html#35802">35802</a>. At <a href="../asm/35735.html#35802">35802</a> a check determines that Berk's
facing-into-screen flag is reset (as it was previously reset by the instruction at <a href="../asm/36116.html#36221">36221</a>). This results in a jump to <a href="../asm/35735.html#35821">35821</a> at which point the script
data for Berk facing out of the screen is executed without an intermediate turning phase.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
This may occur whether or not Berk is already holding something, however it does not happen if Berk is facing into the screen because he has just picked
something up from behind him.

is set but in the latter, this pixel is reset:

The graphic layout data for the edible eyes on level 3 uses the wrong graphic index for the eye on the right in the "looking ahead" state (<a href="../asm/40192.html#40219">40219</a>). The
value at <a href="../asm/40192.html#40222">40222</a> is 33 (eye looking to the left) when it should be 29 (eye looking ahead). To fix:

The main block of graphic layout data for level 3's edible eyes lies at <a href="../asm/40192.html">40192</a>. This block is set up to select one of the following seven graphic
layout data addresses and render the graphic layout data at that selected address. However the following list actually contains eight addresses. The
eighth, <a href="../asm/40192.html#40247">40247</a> located at <a href="../asm/40192.html#40210">40210</a>, is not included in the random address selection because the instruction at <a href="../asm/40192.html#40194">40194</a> states that there are seven
addresses, not eight. The eighth address corresponds to the eyes looking to the left. This final address can be included in the random selection via a

The ceiling of the door room on level 2 contains a glitch. The lower character block at the rightmost side of the left ceiling section appears to be an
eye, rather than rock! This happens because the wrong graphic index is used in the graphic layout data at <a href="../asm/50801.html#51195">51195</a>. This can be fixed with a couple of
POKEs:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/50801.html#51195">51195</a>,20 (to use a rock graphic rather than an eye)<br />
POKE <a href="../asm/50801.html#51195">51196</a>,194 (to apply a vertical mirror to the rock graphic)

<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a href="../asm/47060.html">47060</a> is used during the defining of keyboard controls to ensure that the same key is not used for two different functions. However the
routine does not function as intended, as it only checks the first five (of seven) controls for duplicates. As a result, the same key can be assigned to
both pause and restart. The routine should check the first six keys instead. To fix:

The routine at <a href="../asm/48738.html">48738</a> attempts to position an entity that is being carried by Berk such that it appears in Berk's hands when he moves left. This
routine should work the same way as the routine at <a href="../asm/48727.html">48727</a>; the entity should be positioned such that its left edge is half of that entity's width to
the left of Berk's left edge. The instruction at <a href="../asm/48738.html#48741">48741</a> incorrectly doubles the amount by which the carried entity is offset, resulting in a mismatch
in the positioning of carried entities when Berk moves left to the positioning when he moves right. This is particularly noticeable for wider entities,
such as the weight on level 3 or the cannon on level 4. To fix, the errant instruction should be removed:

When Berk bends down while facing forwards, he takes on the appearance defined in the graphic layout data at <a href="../asm/58119.html">58119</a>. Berk's left hand, however, has one
character that is not quite right. A vertical mirror should be applied to this character to correct its appearance. To fix:

<div class="box-title">Trap Door closing</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a href="../asm/36966.html">36966</a> controls the Trap Door closing when Berk and Drutt have passed through. The conditions that have to be met for the Trap Door to
close are:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="">
<li>Berk is not in room 1 (Trap Door room), and</li>
<li>Drutt is in room 4 (room at the bottom of the Trap Door's shaft)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
It is possible, however, to complete all levels in the game without meeting both of these conditions simultaneously; in this case the Trap Door would
remain open, and upon returning to level 1 at the end of the game, Berk, Boni and Drutt would all fall down the Trap Door again! The way to achieve this
would be to send Drutt down the Trap Door first and have him accomplish all of his tasks for level 1 (i.e. knock down the key and push the red sweet
into the pit). Then, leaving Drutt in the pit, switching to Berk and having him finish off the level would ensure that the Trap Door would remain open.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Fixing this issue is not such a simple matter as checking that both Berk and Drutt are not in room 1. It is possible that Berk has already gone through
the Trap Door and Drutt is jumping up from the Trap Door room to the room above. When coming back down, Drutt would find himself stranded because of the
now-closed Trap Door.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Ideally, to fix this, we would look for an occasion when Berk and Drutt are guaranteed to be in a room together, and through the Trap Door. This indeed
happens at the end of level 1 when they must both be present in the room with the exit door:
