the top and bottom y-coordinates are given as 115. This means that the slots are considered to be only one character high in the game's logic, despite

If Berk has collided with an entity of class 129 (as checked at <a href="../asm/36116.html#36249">36249</a>) causing him to fall to the right, he is made to drop any entity he is carrying

It can be tricky to get past the three spiders on Level 1; fortunately, players who have difficulty are given some consideration. In the routine at
<a href="../asm/37718.html">37718</a> that controls the spiders' return to their homes, there is a check on the number of times Berk has been killed by a spider, as stored at
<a href="../asm/34221.html#34223">34223</a>. The greater this value is, the longer the right-most spider will wait at its home position before beginning its next attack. A

its top edge (see <a href="../asm/38756.html#38762">38762</a>). The instruction (at <a href="../asm/38592.html#38620">38620</a>) subsequent to this CALL loads A with the same value.

Level 4's Skeleton is defined in an entry at <a href="../asm/45274.html#45404">45404</a> to have a width of two characters (left and right edges at 128 and 129 respectively), when it is
clearly significantly wider. In fact when checking for a collision between the skeleton and Berk, this reduced width has to be compensated for by a
subtraction at <a href="../asm/41498.html#41528">41528</a>.

It is possible that this was done so that the cannon's projectile has to visibly penetrate the skeleton rather than merely impact on its left edge.

<div class="box-title">Flags Galore</div>
<div class="paragraph">
A large number of flags are used to support the logic of Through the Trap Door. These flags are represented by individual bits in the various entities'
complex state data. Although many of these flags are applicable to all entities and use the same bit for each entity, many are applicable only to a
single entity, or a subset of entities. For example, bit 6 of byte 10 of an entity's complex state data generally represents that entity's "Can Fall"
Flag, however bit 4 of byte 9 is the "Is Carrying an Object" Flag for Berk only. Some bits are used for several different purposes. Here is a list of
the more significant flags, along with the entity / entities to which they apply:

<div class="paragraph">
The address <a href="../asm/49705.html#49934">49934</a> lies within a block of graphic layout data responsible for defining Level 3's glowing tangleweeds. The rendering instructions at
this address are used by several different variants of tangleweed. The instruction at this location is one that selects an address at random from a list
and jumps to it; this is used to make the tangleweeds blink between green and yellow at random. The random selection is weighted so that green is twice
as likely to be selected as yellow, however this is done by defining the green tangleweed twice (at <a href="../asm/49705.html#49942">49942</a> and again at <a href="../asm/49705.html#49952">49952</a>). The same effect could
have been achieved simply by listing the "green" address twice; this would have also saved a few bytes.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
A side-effect (and perhaps the originally intended purpose) of this is that a third colour can be chosen for the tangleweeds in addition to green and
yellow. Either of the existing instructions relating to the green colour can be changed to introduce the third colour:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/49705.html#49942">49943</a>,x
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
or
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE <a href="../asm/49705.html#49952">49953</a>,x
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
where x is the index of the required colour.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The same situation exists further on, at <a href="../asm/49705.html#49971">49971</a>, where another set of tangleweeds is defined in the same way.
</div>

<div><span id="heightofweight"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Height of Weight</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The weight on Level 3 is defined as being three characters high in its complex definition data at <a href="../asm/44608.html#44933">44933</a>, yet its graphic layout data at <a href="../asm/41175.html">41175</a>
contains instructions for drawing four character rows of UDGs. As a result, the top of the weight is one character above where it should be when held by
Berk. This is not a bug, however, and the resulting effect looks quite natural given that the weight is apparently bottom-heavy.
</div>

<div><span id="graphicswiderthandisplay"></span></div>

<div class="paragraph">
Parts of some graphics (e.g. the stalactites defined at <a href="../asm/50801.html#51202">51202</a>) lie outside the displayed area. Such graphics may still be partially displayed when
assigned to a simple or complex entity, as long as that entity's top and left edges are positioned such that part of the graphic falls into the display
area.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
For example, only the left-most seven of the nine stalactites at defined at <a href="../asm/50801.html#51202">51202</a> will be shown if the entity to which that graphic layout address is
assigned has its left edge at an x-coordinate of zero. If an x-coordinate of -2 is given, then eight of the nine stalactites will be shown. An
x-coordinate of -4 will show the last eight stalactites, with the first being off-screen to the left.

The routine at <a href="../asm/45965.html">45965</a> populates the Primary Display Buffer with graphic layout data for an entity. During this population process, a check is done at

there is no way for this to be the case, so this check is redundant.

<a href="../asm/52315.html#52351">52351</a> where another check is done to see if Drutt's depth level is 1. Since each of these conditions is the inverse of the other, there is no way for

locations, there is a list of graphic layout data addresses to be rendered sequentially to give the illusion of motion. Each of these lists contains
eight addresses, however the eighth entry in each list is not used because the instructions at the start of the lists (<a href="../asm/55698.html#55746">55746</a> and <a href="../asm/56210.html#56284">56284</a>) states that

The routine at <a href="../asm/48791.html">48791</a> is unused. As it deals primarily with data offset by 4, 5, 6 and 7 bytes from the values in the IX and IY registers, it is
reasonable to assume that IX and IY hold the addresses of complex state data for two entities. This is supported by the instructions at <a href="../asm/48791.html#48838">48838</a> and
<a href="../asm/48791.html#48841">48841</a> which do a check on the value of the data eight bytes on from the address in IX (the class field in complex state data); this check looks for a
value of 31 which is Berk's class value.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
It is possible that this routine was intended for use with the Clawed Foot on Level 3, with IY representing the foot and IX representing the entity
being picked up by the foot. Given the check at <a href="../asm/48791.html#48838">48838-48841</a> it seems that originally the Clawed Foot may have been capable of picking up more
than just Berk. Perhaps the Coloured Creatures puzzle was originally intended to be complicated by the Clawed Foot rearranging the creatures as well as
attacking Berk. If this was the case, it may be that this was deemed too problematic to implement, and so the idea of having the creatures spontaneously
switch positions was developed instead.
