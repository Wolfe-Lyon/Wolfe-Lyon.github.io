<div class="box-title">Missing Puff of Smoke Frame</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a href="../asm/39958.html">39958</a> is responsible for animating the Puff of Smoke. The instruction at <a href="../asm/39958.html#39972">39972</a> initialises a loop counter to five with the intention
of iterating over all Puff of Smoke graphic frames at <a href="../asm/31377.html">31377</a>. There are, however, six frames, so the sixth is never drawn. It is possible that this bug
is related to the fact that in Spellbound (which uses the same Puff of Smoke graphics), the routine that draws all six frames uses a somewhat different
mechanism to do so; the Spellbound drawing method uses a loop counter initialised to five to draw six frames.

<div class="paragraph">
When Magic Knight takes an object from a character, that character's "take an object" routine is executed. The start addresses of these routines are
listed in a table at <a href="../asm/42069.html">42069</a>, and Off-White's routine is located at <a href="../asm/42085.html">42085</a>. All Off-White's routine does, however, is to check whether the object being
taken is an egg, and if so have Off-White refuse to hand it over. Off-White tends to be rather trigger-happy in other circumstances and so should be
here too.

<div class="box-title">Off-White and Grunter Don't Kill on Giving an Object</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When Magic Knight gives an object to a character, that character's "give an object" routine is executed. The start addresses of these routines are
listed in a table at <a href="../asm/42413.html">42413</a>; Off-White's routine is located at <a href="../asm/42429.html">42429</a> and Grunter's routine is located at <a href="../asm/42488.html">42488</a>.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
All Grunter's routine does is to transfer the object in question to Magic Knight's inventory. As Grunter readily kills Magic Knight if he tries to take
an object, the beast should also kill when an object is given.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Off-White's routine checks whether the object being given is the Brass Ankh, and if so it is refused. A jump is then made to <a href="../asm/42429.html#42437">42437</a> to a non-existent
code address. The result of this is that the game will freeze if Magic Knight attempts to give an object to his evil counterpart. While Off-White's
refusal of the ankh is consistent with his dark nature, he should really kill Magic Knight instead.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To fix Grunter's "give an object" routine so that he kills Magic Knight, it should be set to <a href="../asm/42244.html">42244</a> or <a href="../asm/45723.html">45723</a>:<br />

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">2x2 Block Drawing</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a href="../asm/41271.html">41271</a> draws 2x2 blocks as defined in the table at <a href="../asm/49794.html">49794</a>. These definitions include a bitmap that determines which of the four
character cells spanned by the block have a terrain interaction parameter applied. The routine functions correctly up to <a href="../asm/41271.html#41398">41398</a>, by which point the
upper two cells have had their terrain interaction parameters correctly applied. The instructions from <a href="../asm/41271.html#41398">41398</a> are intended to advance the terrain
interaction data pointer down one character row and paint the lower two cells, however the instructions are in the wrong order. The instructions at
<a href="../asm/41271.html#41398">41398</a> - <a href="../asm/41271.html#41402">41402</a> load B with the Terrain Interaction Painting Bitmap and A with the terrain interaction parameter to apply. Then the instructions at
<a href="../asm/41271.html#41405">41405</a> - <a href="../asm/41271.html#41411">41411</a> advance the terrain interaction data pointer by 32 bytes by adding 32 in BC. When BC is loaded with 32 at <a href="../asm/41271.html#41408">41408</a>, the Terrain
Interaction Painting Bitmap value is lost, and therefore from <a href="../asm/41271.html#41412">41412</a> onwards the value in B is zero.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In order to fix this bug, the two blocks of code, <a href="../asm/41271.html#41398">41398</a> - <a href="../asm/41271.html#41402">41402</a> inclusive, and <a href="../asm/41271.html#41405">41405</a> - <a href="../asm/41271.html#41411">41411</a> inclusive, should be switched in position.

<div class="box-title">Spelling and Punctuation</div>
<div class="paragraph">
There are a number of spelling and punctuation issues:
<ul class="">
<li>The text entry at <a href="../asm/52878.html#53258">53258</a> contains "EXTREEME" instead of "EXTREME"</li>
<li>The text entry at <a href="../asm/52878.html#53607">53607</a> contains "HUNNEY" instead of "HONEY" (or "HUNNY", <a href="facts.html#undreadableteddybear">see trivia</a>)</li>
<li>The text entry at <a href="../asm/54586.html#54837">54837</a> contains "THROW" instead of "THROWN"</li>
<li>The text entry at <a href="../asm/54902.html#55083">55083</a> contains "DISQUISE" instead of "DISGUISES"</li>
<li>The text entries at <a href="../asm/56843.html#56850">56850</a> and <a href="../asm/57693.html#58256">58256</a> are missing apostrophes</li>
<li>The text entry at <a href="../asm/57693.html#57867">57867</a> contains "DISQUISE" instead of "DISGUISE"</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
For reasons of consistency, "disquise" is used in place of "disguise" throughout this disassembly.

<div class="paragraph">
The byte at <a href="../asm/23709.html#23714">23714</a> determines the index of the current Scroll substring from the list of strings at <a href="../asm/54902.html">54902</a>. This index is capped at 7, however there
is an eighth (and therefore unused) substring at <a href="../asm/54902.html#55139">55139</a>.
