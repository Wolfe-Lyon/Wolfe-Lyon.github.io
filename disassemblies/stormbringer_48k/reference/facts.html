<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Cheat mode</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Stormbringer has a cheat / debug mode built in. Address <a href="../asm/23728.html">23728</a> is the cheat-mode-enabled flag, and if this is set (i.e. contains any non-zero value)
then cheat mode becomes available:<br />
POKE <a href="../asm/23728.html">23728</a>,255
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When cheat mode is enabled, pressing DOWN while controlling Magic Knight will result in a prompt sound being played, and the border turning red. After
this, it is possible to change Magic Knight's current room. Pressing LEFT or RIGHT decreases or increases, respectively, Magic Knight's current room
index by one. Pressing UP or DOWN increases or decreases, respectively, Magic Knight's current room index by eight. After Magic Knight's current room
index is changed, the new room is drawn. Pressing FIRE causes a return to the game.

<div><span id="command_locate"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">LOCATE command</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Although the 128k version of Stormbringer includes the LOCATE command, the 48k version does not. Despite this, there remain some data and instructions
in the 48k version that appear to be related to the LOCATE command. Much of the code is similar to that related to the LOCATE command in Spellbound:
<ul class="">
<li>compass-glow-update flag at <a href="../asm/23436.html">23436</a></li>
<li>coordinates of top-left corner of currently glowing locate compass sector at <a href="../asm/23471.html">23471</a></li>
<li>instructions between <a href="../asm/62178.html#62214">62214</a> and <a href="../asm/62178.html#62252">62252</a> (inclusive)</li>

</div>
<div><span id="debug_code_001"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Leftover debug code, part 1</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a href="../asm/37689.html">37689</a> displays and handles the input device selection menu, and the instructions from <a href="../asm/37689.html#37722">37722</a> onward are executed when the currently
selected input device is changed. The instructions between <a href="../asm/37689.html#37723">37723</a> and <a href="../asm/37689.html#37742">37742</a> seem to be set up to highlight the control device that was previously
selected whenever a new one is chosen. The previously selected menu item is highlighted via a change in attribute for a character cell to the left of
that item in the menu. The attribute used is 71 (white INK, black PAPER, BRIGHT), so the change will normally not be visible since there is nothing
drawn in the cell in question and its PAPER is already black. Changing the value at <a href="../asm/37689.html#37740">37741</a> to a different value can make the highlighting
visible.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="debug_code_002"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Leftover debug code, part 2</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The flag at <a href="../asm/23461.html">23461</a> determines whether or not only the top two character cells in 2 × 2 blocks are drawn. This flag is never modified
anywhere in the game code, and so presumably exists only for debugging or development purposes. In order for the 2 × 1 drawing mode to
function correctly (i.e. to move to the top-left cell of the next block to the right), an otherwise redundant instruction at <a href="../asm/41271.html#41322">41322</a> advances the bitmap
virtual text cursor right by one character. When the draw-2-×-1-blocks flag is reset, this advancing to the top-left cell of the next block
to the left occurs at <a href="../asm/41271.html#41423">41423</a> and <a href="../asm/41271.html#41426">41426</a>.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="number_of_the_day"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Password number</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Whenever a new game is started, the routine at <a href="../asm/38024.html">38024</a> is jumped to. This routine initialises data for the new game, including the password number which
is required to activate the teleport from the castle to the spaceship. One of Magic Knight's tasks is to encode this number to a series of bits and pull
those main levers that correspond to the number's set bits. Two of the levers, representing bits 5 (<a href="../asm/59798.html">59798</a>) and 6 (<a href="../asm/59772.html">59772</a>) of the number, lie beyond
the security door (<a href="../asm/59841.html">59841</a>). The code that generates the number (<a href="../asm/38024.html">38024</a> - <a href="../asm/38024.html#38034">38034</a> inclusive) is set up to ensure that at least one of bits 5 and 6 is
set, thereby forcing Magic Knight to have to deal with the security door.

</div>
<div><span id="redundant_instructions"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Redundant instructions / code</div>
<div class="paragraph">
There are many instances of redundant code, or redundant instructions in several texts. Some examples are:
<ul class="">
<li>the routine at <a href="../asm/38841.html">38841</a> changes Magic Knight's current room index to the value in <span class="register">A</span>, however Magic Knight's room is also updated to the same value immediately prior to that routine being called at <a href="../asm/40406.html#40431">40431</a>, <a href="../asm/40437.html#40483">40483</a> and <a href="../asm/40546.html#40592">40592</a></li>
<li>the routines at <a href="../asm/40729.html">40729</a>, <a href="../asm/40752.html">40752</a>, <a href="../asm/40765.html">40765</a>, <a href="../asm/40784.html">40784</a>, <a href="../asm/41059.html">41059</a> have been copied from Knight Tyme but are unused</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../asm/41271.html#41274">41274</a> loads <span class="register">L</span> with a value, but that value is overwritten at <a href="../asm/41271.html#41276">41276</a> without having been used</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../asm/44337.html#44403">44403</a> loads <span class="register">A</span> with the index of the Current Object, but that value is overwritten immediately afterwards in the call to <a href="../asm/45601.html">45601</a> and again at <a href="../asm/44337.html#44409">44409</a> without having been used</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../asm/44635.html#44778">44778</a> checks whether the Current Object that has been selected as the target of the UNWEAR command is the Teddy Bear in order to display the "THE BEAR SAYS..." message, however this can never happen because the Teddy Bear can't be worn</li>
<li>the routine at <a href="../asm/45670.html">45670</a> checks whether the Current Character is carrying the object with index in <span class="register">E</span>, however this routine is unused. An ideal place to have used it would have been in Aramis's "command a character to help" routine at <a href="../asm/45227.html">45227</a>.</li>
<li>the instructions at <a href="../asm/38024.html#38121">38121 - 38123</a> do nothing. In the equivalent routine in Knight Tyme, the instructions in these positions set the least significant byte of the frame counter (FRAMES system variable) to zero. In Knight Tyme, however, FRAMES was not used as heavily as it is in Stormbringer.</li>
<li>the instructions at <a href="../asm/40437.html">40437 - 40438</a>, part of the room-specific routine for transporting Magic Knight between the teleports, set the BORDER to black and reset the speaker state. There is no apparent need to do this, however.</li>
<li>the instructions between <a href="../asm/42494.html#42587">42587</a> and <a href="../asm/42494.html#42595">42595</a> are unnecessary, and replacing them with <span class="instruction">LD C,A</span>; <span class="instruction">JR 42601</span> results in the same functionality. The table at <a href="../asm/48535.html">48535</a> is likewise unnecessary</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../asm/42638.html#42795">42795</a> resets the most significant bit of the current character's status text index, however this bit can never be set so this instruction is unnecessary.</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../asm/43250.html#43255">43255</a> writes a 32 (SPACE character) at the end of the "[Current Character's short name] CANNOT HELP YOU&#160;&#160;" text at <a href="../asm/52523.html#52770">52770</a> even though this text already ends with two SPACE characters. It is possible that this was intentional, to enable variations of the message, e.g. "[Character] CANNOT HELP YOU YET", or "[Character] CANNOT HELP YOU HERE".</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../asm/63691.html#63721">63721</a> is a jump to the instruction immediately after</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../asm/64687.html#64753">64753</a> loads <span class="register">A</span> with zero unnecessarily</li>
<li>the text entry at <a href="../asm/50138.html#50360">50360</a> has an instruction to change INK colour to yellow, followed by an instruction to change INK colour to white</li>
<li>the text entry at <a href="../asm/50640.html">50640</a> has a repeated instruction to change INK colour to yellow</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../asm/46902.html#46929">46929</a> causes a conditional jump to <a href="../asm/47178.html">47178</a> if the end of the text to print is encountered. However the instruction at <a href="../asm/47178.html">47178</a> is a simple <span class="instruction">RET</span>. The same result could have been achieved with a <span class="instruction">RET Z</span> instruction at <a href="../asm/46902.html#46929">46929</a>.</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../initialisation/37632.html#37636">37636</a> loads RAM address <a href="../asm/23364.html">23364</a> with zero, however this address is never used.</li>
<li>the instruction at <a href="../asm/38024.html#38109">38109</a> loads RAM address <a href="../asm/23481.html#23486">23486</a> with zero, however this address is never used.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="command_increases_happiness"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Commanding a character makes him or her happier</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When Magic Knight uses the Wand of Command to command a character, that character's happiness is increased by two points (see <a href="../asm/43043.html#43092">43092-43094</a>).
This is the opposite effect to that in Knight Tyme, where characters' happiness is decreased when Magic Knight commands them. It is possible that this
is intended behaviour, however it diminishes the effect of the lower limit on happiness before a character will obey Magic Knight, as he can repeatedly
command an unhappy and unwilling character until that character's happiness is raised above the threshold for compliance.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="off_white_drawing"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Drawing Off-White Knight</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The instructions between <a href="../asm/39883.html#39904">39904 - 39907</a> inclusive (part of the character drawing routine at <a href="../asm/39883.html">39883</a>) are executed only if the character being
drawn has a graphic index of zero, i.e. the character should not be drawn. For any other character, these instructions skip over the block of code that
draws the character to screen. Off-White, however, is drawn even if his graphic index has been set to zero, in which case, he would appear as a jumbled
bitmap:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<img src="../images/trivia/drawingoffwhiteknight01.png" />
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The purpose of this check is not clear as Off-White's graphic index cannot be set to zero by any means other than a POKE.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="unreadable_sword"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Unreadable sword</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Certain objects in the game are not readable unless Magic Knight is holding the Crystal Ball. If he attempts to read one of these objects without the
Crystal Ball, a message is shown stating that there is writing present in a magic language that cannot be read. The instructions between <a href="../asm/43494.html#43541">43541 -
43590</a> check whether the object being read is one of these objects, and if so allow Magic Knight to read the language if he is also carrying the Crystal
Ball. The instructions between <a href="../asm/43494.html#43568">43568 - 43572</a> deal with the Sword, however the index of the text revealed is 3, corresponding to the original
unreadable text message! One of the two unused texts, which is located at <a href="../asm/52878.html#53294">53294</a>, seems a likely, if silly, candidate for the true text on the sword.
Perhaps this was ultimately rejected because it is a little <em>too</em> silly.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="unreadable_teddy_bear"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Unreadable teddy bear</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When the Teddy Bear is read, the text shown is "TNORF OT KCAB" (<a href="../asm/52878.html#52964">52964</a>). Given that some objects have texts that cannot be read unless Magic Knight is
in possession of the Crystal Ball, one would assume that the Mirror would reveal the Teddy Bear's text, however this is not the case. Although the Teddy
Bear's true text is in the game (<a href="../asm/52878.html#53607">53607</a>), it cannot be accessed. This text contains a spelling error ("HUNNEY" instead of "HONEY"). The name of the
bear, Milne, is undoubtedly a reference to A. A. Milne and "HUNNEY" is close to Winnie-the-Pooh's spelling, "HUNNY". See also

One of the requirements for the success of Magic Knight's mission is that Off-White is asleep when Dimension Merge is cast. An essential task for Magic
Knight to complete is to put Off-White to sleep by throwing the Magic Missile. Unlike other characters, Off-White does not tire while awake; in fact he
continually regenerates. The <a href="../asm/62895.html">rates of change of his stats</a> while awake are all positive ensuring he never falls asleep independently.
