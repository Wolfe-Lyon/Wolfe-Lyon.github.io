<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">"THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS ROOM" message never shown</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the routine at <a href="../asm/29330.html">29330</a> that processes Magic Knight's "PICK UP OBJECT" command, the section of code starting at <a href="../asm/29330.html#29339">29339</a> is intended to count the
number of objects present in Magic Knight's current room. This count of objects is accumulated in the <span class="register">C</span> register, and after the total (copied into
<span class="register">A</span>) is compared with zero at <a href="../asm/29330.html#29358">29358</a>, a conditional jump occurs to <a href="../asm/55192.html">55192</a> to display the "THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS ROOM" message window should the
total be zero. Unfortunately this does not work as intended because the <span class="register">C</span> register is not initialised to zero at the beginning of the count.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The instruction at <a href="../asm/29330.html#29342">29342</a> (<span class="instruction">LD BC,3200</span>) actually initialises <span class="register">C</span> to 128, so the count can never equal zero. Additionally, this same
instruction should initialise <span class="register">B</span> (the number of objects to check to determine whether they are in Magic Knight's current room) to 37 as there are 37
objects in the game; instead <span class="register">B</span> is initialised to 12. So as it stands, this routine only counts the number of objects among the first 12 that are in
Magic Knight's current room, and adds this total to 128. Therefore it is clearly impossible for the count to hold any value outside the range 128 - 140
(i.e. it is never zero), so the "THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS ROOM" message is never shown. Instead, the "THERE IS NOTHING NEAR ENOUGH" message is shown:

</div>

The offending instruction should actually be <span class="instruction">LD BC,9472</span>.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To fix, and ensure that <span class="register">B</span> and <span class="register">C</span> are initialised to 37 and 0 respectively:<br />

<div class="box-title">Too many objects are checked</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Another bug, related to the one above, involves the routine at <a href="../asm/29330.html">29330</a>. The instruction at <a href="../asm/29330.html#29374">29374</a> loads <span class="register">B</span> with 50, in preparation for a loop
iterating over all objects' positions, however there are only 37 objects in the game. As a result of this bug, the code that checks the positions of
objects runs over the end of the objects' current positions table at <a href="../asm/25286.html">25286</a> and into the current planetary data table at <a href="../asm/25397.html">25397</a>. Due to the nature of
the data stored from <a href="../asm/25397.html">25397</a> onwards, it seems that a conflict (i.e. a false match with an "object") is unlikely, so in most circumstances this bug will
not manifest any symptoms.

<div class="box-title">Examine USS Pisces</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The instruction at <a href="../asm/30145.html#30199">30199</a> is intended to check whether or not Magic Knight is aboard the USS Pisces when attempting to examine the starship. If Magic
Knight is not aboard the ship, a message window should be displayed ("YOU CANNOT EXAMINE THE USS PISCES IF YOU ARE NOT ABOARD THE MAIN SECTION OF THE
SHIP"). In order to check whether or not Magic Knight is aboard the USS Pisces, his current room's index is compared against the number 12 which is the
index of the McTablet Food room on Starbase 1. However, if Magic Knight is in the room to the left of this (The Transporter Room, Starbase 1, index 11)
then the check is passed even though he is not aboard the starship. The instruction here should instead check Magic Knight's current room index against
11, i.e. it should be <span class="instruction">CP 11</span>, not <span class="instruction">CP 12</span>.

The routine at <a href="../asm/31312.html">31312</a> processes the command to cast a lightning bolt. When Magic Knight casts a lightning bolt at the Control Column, the instruction
at <a href="../asm/31312.html#31374">31374</a> (<span class="instruction">OR 3</span>) is intended to set the tyme-machine-charged flag, however as well as doing this it also sets the barriers-removed flag. The
tyme-machine-charged flag is stored in bit 1 of the byte at <a href="../asm/23403.html">23403</a>, so the instruction should be <span class="instruction">OR 2</span>.

<div class="box-title">Incorrect window type</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When Magic Knight has his accident with the glue, photograph and blank ID card, an information window is displayed explaining that happened. However
this window is not really an information window - it's a menu window! The instruction at <a href="../asm/34265.html#34463">34463</a> calls the routine for drawing menu windows and as a
result the hand cursor is also drawn. This isn't really noticeable though, since immediately after drawing the window and hand cursor, the text is
printed, overwriting the hand cursor graphic.

<div class="box-title">Starfield rendering</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The instruction at <a href="../asm/36273.html#36301">36301</a> is <span class="instruction">LD C,A</span>, however it appears the correct instruction should be <span class="instruction">LD A,C</span> as we are checking (in <span class="register">A</span>) that the
x-component of a star's direction is non-zero when its y-component has already been checked as zero. As it is, the value in <span class="register">A</span> is not modified from
instruction at <a href="../asm/36273.html#36294">36294</a> where it is set to the y-component. In the existing code, the value of <span class="register">A</span> is set at <a href="../asm/36273.html#36294">36294</a>, then at <a href="../asm/36273.html#36299">36299</a> a conditional
jump occurs if the value in <span class="register">A</span> is not 70. If the jump does not occur, then the (same) value in <span class="register">A</span> is loaded into <span class="register">C</span>, then another conditional
jump occurs only if the (unchanged) value in <span class="register">A</span> is equal to 128 (which is can't be, because this instruction is only reached if <span class="register">A</span> is 70!)
