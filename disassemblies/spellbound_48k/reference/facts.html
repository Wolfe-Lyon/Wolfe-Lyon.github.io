<div class="box-title">Cheat mode</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Spellbound has a cheat / debug mode built in. As soon as the game is loaded, the instructions between <a href="../initialisation/26627.html#26633">26633</a> - <a href="../initialisation/26627.html#26640">26640</a>
disable the cheat mode, but it can be restored by:<br />
POKE <a href="../asm/27176.html#27236">27236</a>,194<br />
POKE <a href="../asm/27176.html#27236">27237</a>,92<br />
POKE <a href="../asm/27176.html#27236">27238</a>,138
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When cheat mode is enabled, pressing DOWN while controlling Magic Knight will result in a prompt sound being played. After this, two main functions
become available. Pressing the X key will cause a return to BASIC, while pressing numeric keys will allow you to transport Magic Knight instantly to
another room. This latter function requires two numeric keys to be pressed, as it is necessary to specify the two-digit room number that you wish to
visit. The first must digit must be between 0 and 4 (as the game's rooms are numbered 00-49). The second digit can be any numeric value. For example,
pressing 0 then 0 will move Magic Knight to room 00 (i.e. The Lift). Pressing any key outside these allowed ranges will immediately resume the game.

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Odd Ball frame numbers</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine <a href="../asm/39125.html">39125</a> that draws the Odd Ball to screen relies on offset frame numbers (116, 117, 118 and 119) rather than absolute frame numbers (e.g. 0,
1, 2 and 3). These frame numbers are relative to an origin at <a href="../asm/63988.html#64500">64500</a> which seems to make little sense at first sight. Why not just set the origin to
65428 (the address of the first Odd Ball frame) and use the more logical frame numbers of 0, 1, 2 and 3? I'm sure there must have been a good reason for
this.

<div><span id="strengthbar"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Drawing the strength bar</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In drawing the strength bar, if Magic Knight's strength is not a multiple of eight, then the strength bar is drawn as groups of eight pixels, then the
remainder over and above a multiple of eight is drawn. If the Magic Knight's strength IS a multiple of eight, however, the second part of the routine
(draw the remainder over and above a multiple of eight) is still executed, but draws nothing (see <span class="instruction">JR <a href="../asm/36215.html#36267">36267</a></span> instruction at <a href="../asm/36215.html#36259">36259</a> - it seems
more logical to have <span class="instruction">JR <a href="../asm/36215.html#36274">36274</a></span> here to skip over the "fractional part drawing".

<div><span id="gimbalcanhelpflag"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Gimbal's can-help flag</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Giving Gimbal the Willow Rod sets his can-help flag (instructions from <a href="../asm/30880.html#30989">30989</a>), even though Gimbal never helps.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="summoningspellpower"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Spell power and summoning</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the summoning routine, the instructions from <a href="../asm/33312.html#33480">33480</a> decrease a summoned character's strength by 10, happiness by 5 and stamina by 12 as well as
Magic Knight's spell power by 3. As the Banshee has no stats, her strength, happiness and stamina are not affected so this part of the routine is
skipped in her case, but Magic Knight's loss of spell power is also skipped over. Does the Banshee's own spell power fuel her summoning, rather than
Magic Knight's spell power, as is the case for other characters? To change this to be consistent with the situation with other characters (i.e. a drain
on Magic Knight's spell power), the instruction <span class="instruction">JP Z,33512</span> at <a href="../asm/33312.html#33477">33477</a> should be changed to <span class="instruction">JP Z,33504</span>.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="emptyinventorycheck"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Empty inventory check</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the routine at <a href="../asm/34914.html">34914</a> that displays a window / menu showing a character's inventory, the beginning of the routine checks for an empty inventory, and
if it is empty, the execution point skips ahead to <a href="../asm/34914.html#35069">35069</a> (displaying a "YOU ARE NOT CARRYING ANYTHING" message). If the inventory is not empty, then
execution of the routine continues, but at <a href="../asm/34914.html#34978">34978</a> there is another check for an empty inventory. How can this check ever be passed if the instruction
that does the check is skipped as a result of the first check?

<div><span id="thewallextrainstruction"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Extra room layout data (the wall)</div>
<div class="paragraph">
At The Wall (before Elrand helps) at <a href="../asm/53289.html">53289</a>, the instruction at <a href="../asm/53289.html#53307">53307</a> is unnecessary as it draws the bottom character block of brickwork in the Wall,
but this is part of the floor and has already been drawn. In fact the immediately preceding instruction at <a href="../asm/53289.html#53306">53306</a> can also be omitted as it just sets
the brickwork drawing mode to one row in preparation for drawing this unnecessary piece.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="glowingbottleatlittlebottle"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Glowing bottle location check</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the room-specific routine at <a href="../asm/29800.html">29800</a>, a check is made at <a href="../asm/29800.html#29812">29812</a>-<a href="../asm/29800.html#29815">29815</a> to determine whether the Glowing Bottle is at The Little Bottle, however
there does not appear to be a way for the Glowing Bottle to actually get there. Any attempt to drop (or throw) the Glowing Bottle causes it to break,
releasing Banshee. Giving the Glowing Bottle to another character while at the Little Bottle doesn't work either - the object's current room index will
be set to 99 and so stop illuminating the room.
