<div class="box-title">Offset candle glow</div>
<div class="paragraph">
On left-facing wall-mounted candles, the "candle flame glow" character blocks (with cycling attributes) don't span the entirety of the flame part of the
graphic bitmap. The image below highlights the two character blocks that are assigned as "glowing"; there is a single pixel column in the flame bitmap
that lies to the left of this, and therefore never glows:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<img src="../images/bugs/offset_candle_glow_1_before.png" />
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this is that after the first (right-most) flame character block is assigned as glowing, the instruction at <a href="../asm/28747.html#28803">28803</a> increases the address
in <span class="register">HL</span> (i.e. advances right by one character block into empty space). An empty (i.e. all bitmap bits reset) character block is then assigned as
glowing but there are no set bits for the glow effect to influence.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In order to fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that after assigning the right-most character block of the flame bitmap as glowing, <span class="register">HL</span> is
DECREASED (i.e. moved LEFT by one character block). That way, the character block to the left, which contains a very noticeable single column of set
pixels, will glow in sync with the rest of the flame. The fix involves updating the instruction at <a href="../asm/28747.html#28803">28803</a> from <span class="instruction">INC HL</span> to <span class="instruction">DEC HL</span>,

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">"THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS ROOM" message never shown</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the routine at <a href="../asm/30222.html">30222</a> that processes Magic Knight's "PICK UP OBJECT" command, the section of code starting at <a href="../asm/30222.html#30234">30234</a> is intended to count the
number of objects present in Magic Knight's current room. This count of objects is accumulated in the <span class="register">C</span> register, and after the total (copied into
<span class="register">A</span>) is compared with zero at <a href="../asm/30222.html#30259">30259</a>, a conditional jump occurs to <a href="../asm/34436.html">34436</a> to display the "THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS ROOM" message window should the
total be zero. Unfortunately this does not work as intended because the <span class="register">C</span> register is not initialised to zero at the beginning of the count.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The instruction at <a href="../asm/30222.html#30238">30238</a> (<span class="instruction">LD BC,3200</span>) actually initialises <span class="register">C</span> to 128, so the count can never equal zero. Additionally, this same
instruction should initialise <span class="register">B</span> (the number of objects to check to determine whether they are in Magic Knight's current room) to 50 as there are 50
objects in the game; instead <span class="register">B</span> is initialised to 12. So as it stands, this routine only counts the number of objects among the first 12 that are in
Magic Knight's current room, and adds this total to 128. Therefore it is clearly impossible for the count to hold any value outside the range 128 - 140
(i.e. it is never zero), so the "THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS ROOM" message is never shown. Instead, the "THERE IS NOTHING NEAR ENOUGH" message is shown:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

There are two rooms in the game, The Little Bottle and The Big Bottle, where the "lights" are turned out, yet both have ceiling candles that are clearly
alight and glowing:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<img src="../images/bugs/light_in_the_dark_1_before.png" />
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To remove these ceiling candles, the room layout data for the two rooms can be modified. Fortunately in both cases, the instructions to display the
ceiling candles are near the end of the layout data, so the fix requires relatively few POKEs:
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In each room's case, doing this will bring the room's layout data end marker forward several bytes, and will leave some former room layout data bytes
redundant. This should not impact the game's operation, however. Unfortunately the sixth room on the 1st Floor uses the same room layout data as the Big
Bottle, so it too will lose its ceiling candles as a result of this fix.

When Magic Knight walks past the Wand of Command, the "sparklies" at its top-left corner acquire his attribute:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<img src="../images/bugs/wand_of_command_attributes_1_before.png" />
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
This occurs because the preserve-attribute flag is not set for the top-left character block of the Wand of Command in its graphics lookup table entry.
The terrain interaction flag value that is set at <a href="../asm/42642.html#42750">42751</a> is 17, which corresponds to preserving attribute on the top-right and bottom-right
character blocks. In reality, the Wand of Command (unlike the Bottle and Engraved Candle which correctly have a value of 17 here) spans all four
character blocks. This being the case, all four character blocks should have their attribute preserved. Of course, it is entirely possible that this was
intentional, perhaps to show Magic Knight exerting some kind of magical influence over the wand as he walks by! To fix:<br />

bugs:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<img src="../images/bugs/gold_goblet_attributes_1_before.png" />
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The Goblet is only one character wide (or at least the set bits in the graphic data at <a href="../asm/62068.html#62292">62292</a> are confined entirely to the two rightmost character
blocks). This being the case, the goblet should have a value of 17 for its terrain interaction flags (like the Bottle and Engraved Candle which also
reside solely in the rightmost character blocks of the 2 × 2 graphic data). The actual value for the Goblet, however, is 85, which
preserves the attributes on all four character blocks. The effect of this can be seen as Magic Knight walks into the space occupied by the Goblet's
leftmost character blocks and which appear empty, yet he is affected by the Goblet's attribute. To fix:<br />

the instruction at <a href="../asm/28092.html#28148">28148</a> that draws Magic Knight before animating the puff of smoke, this routine is also used to facilitate other characters'

<div class="paragraph">
In the rightmost room on the 3rd floor (More Plant Room), you may have noticed a brief flicker towards the lower right of the screen. The reason for
this is that, when drawing the ledge that Magic Knight must use to reach the upper part of the room, the drawing routine goes too far down:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<img src="../images/bugs/underground_block_1_before.png" />

<div class="paragraph">
This is caused by the room layout data "instruction" at <a href="../asm/53100.html#53119">53119</a> which has nine 2 × 2 blocks of brickwork drawn, in a vertical fashion, when
only two are needed. The third block of these nine, which appears at floor-level and extends below, does not persist as the in-game window at the bottom
of the screen immediately overwrites it. Because at this point the room drawing routine is in vertical brickwork direction mode thanks to the
instruction at <a href="../asm/53100.html#53115">53115</a>, the room drawing "cursor" wraps around from bottom to top, so the remaining six blocks are actually superimposed upon the room's
right-hand wall. This can be fixed by changing the room layout data to define a column of blocks of length 2, rather than 9:<br />

Many years ago I discovered an interesting teleport-related exploit that could be used to gain access to certain areas of the game earlier than intended
(i.e. right of The Tower, and The Wall). The trick is simple; holding the Teleport Pad and Key, walk right up to a wall that you want to get past, then
drop the Teleport Pad. You will notice that the Teleport Pad's cyan / white attribute will override the attribute of the wall. At this stage, teleport,
and you will materialise partly within the wall, and the cyan / white attribute will extend to Magic Knight's full height. At this stage, it is possible
to walk further into the wall, pick up the Teleport Pad and repeat the process a second time. This time the entire width of the wall will be cyan /
white, allowing Magic Knight free passage to the other side!

<div class="box-title">A block too far, part 2</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Another problem with room drawing can be seen at The Pit. Like in the block too far, part 1 bug above, the room drawing routine also draws brickwork
blocks too far down at The Pit. Unlike the previous bug, however, the cause of the issue this time is not due to an error in the room layout data.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The Pit is unique, in that it is the only room in the game where the lowest row of bricks drawn (typically a room's floor) is not defined as a single
stretch of 16 brickwork (or other) blocks drawn in brickwork drawing mode 1 (single row mode). The floor is, in fact, divided up into three sections.
The left and right sections are conventional brickwork, however the middle section is flame.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When drawing the left-most stretch of bottom-row bricks, the room drawing routine is correctly in brickwork drawing mode 1 (as specified by the data at
<a href="../asm/53703.html#53739">53739</a>). However the instructions at <a href="../asm/27865.html#28056">28056</a>-<a href="../asm/27865.html#28057">28057</a> cause the brickwork drawing mode to automatically revert to mode 0 (draw two rows of bricks) after
any stretch of brickwork is drawn. Consequently, the middle flame section and the right-most brickwork sections of The Pit's lowest level are drawn in
drawing mode 0. In the case of the flames, this doesn't matter, as the lowest two character blocks in their architecture style (defined at <a href="../asm/54617.html#54677">54677</a>) are
blank, however in the right-most stretch of 6 blocks it does, and 2 × 2 blocks of brickwork are drawn as a result:
